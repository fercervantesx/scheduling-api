# Next.js + tRPC + NextAuth.js + Vercel Migration Plan

## Migration Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to migrate the current Scheduling API from its Express.js architecture to a modern Next.js application utilizing tRPC, NextAuth.js, and deployed on Vercel. The migration will maintain the existing Prisma ORM for database operations.

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - TypeScript end-to-end type safety with tRPC
   - Enhanced development workflow with Next.js
   - Simplified API development through tRPC's procedure-based approach
   - Better code organization with Next.js file-based routing

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Server Components for improved SEO and initial load
   - Edge runtime options for global performance
   - Automatic code splitting and optimized bundle sizes

3. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - Simplified auth flow with NextAuth.js
   - Improved session management
   - Easier social login integration

4. **Deployment and Scaling Benefits**
   - Simplified deployment through Vercel
   - Automatic CI/CD pipeline
   - Built-in analytics and monitoring
   - Global edge network for improved response times

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS
- Set up tRPC server and client
- Configure NextAuth.js with Auth0 provider
- Migrate database schema and Prisma setup
- Create utility libraries and shared components

### Phase 2: API Migration
- Implement tRPC routers for all current Express routes
- Set up tenant isolation and multi-tenancy support
- Implement validation schemas with Zod
- Develop middleware for authentication and tenant context

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard
- Create dashboard layout with navigation
- Implement tenant-specific branding context
- Build UI components for CRUD operations
- Implement responsive design patterns

### Phase 4: Deployment and Production Setup
- Configure Vercel deployment
- Set up database infrastructure
- Configure cron jobs for background tasks
- Implement monitoring and analytics
- Set up DNS and domain strategy for multi-tenant support

## Migration Documents

1. [Project Setup](./01-project-setup.md) - Initial Next.js setup, dependencies, and configuration
2. [tRPC Routers Implementation](./02-trpc-routers.md) - Creating tRPC procedures to replace Express routes
3. [Admin Dashboard Implementation](./03-admin-dashboard.md) - Building the tenant admin interface
4. [Deployment with Vercel](./04-deployment.md) - Production setup and deployment configuration

## Required Skills and Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for code reliability
- **Next.js**: React framework for application structure
- **tRPC**: End-to-end typesafe API layer
- **Prisma**: Database ORM (continuing from current project)
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Zod**: Schema validation
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1 week

Total estimated time: 5-8 weeks, depending on complexity and resource allocation.

## Migration Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data migration issues | High | Create comprehensive test cases for database operations |
| Auth flow disruption | High | Implement parallel auth systems during transition |
| API incompatibility | Medium | Maintain backward compatibility layer |
| Performance regression | Medium | Benchmark before and after migration |
| Learning curve for team | Medium | Schedule training sessions for new technologies |
| Deployment complexities | Low | Create detailed deployment documentation |

## Success Criteria

- All existing functionality preserved
- All automated tests passing
- Equal or better performance metrics
- Improved developer experience
- Simplified deployment process
- Enhanced maintainability and extensibility
